But because Tommy Franks did such a great job in planning the operations, we moved rapidly, and a lot of the Baathists and Saddam loyalists laid down their arms and disappeared. I thought they would stay and fight, but they didnt. And now were fighting them now. And its hard work. I understand how hard it is. I get the casualty reports every day. I see on the TV screens how hard it is. But its necessary work. And Im optimistic. See, I think you can be realistic and optimistic at the same time. Im optimistic well achieve \u2014 I know we wont achieve if we send mixed signals. I know were not going to achieve our objective if we send mixed signals to our troops, our friends, the Iraqi citizens. Weve got a plan in place. The plan says there will be elections in January, and there will be. The plan says well train Iraqi soldiers so they can do the hard work, and we are. And its not only just America, but NATO is now helping, Jordans helping train police, UAE is helping train police. Weve allocated $7 billion over the next months for reconstruction efforts. And were making progress there. And our alliance is strong. And as I just told you, theres going to be a summit of the Arab nations. Japan will be hosting a summit. Were making progress. It is hard work. It is hard work to go from a tyranny to a democracy. Its hard work to go from a place where people get their hands cut off, or executed, to a place where people are free. But its necessary work. And a free Iraq is going to make this world a more peaceful place."

It is important to proceed with caution and carefully evaluate the potential impact of any proposed changes before implementing them. By taking a measured approach, we can better assess which reforms are truly effective and in the best interest of all involved."

According to World Population Review, Singapore ranked 161 out of 182 countries in terms of crime rate in 2020. Moreover, a survey by the Institute of Policy Studies in Singapore revealed that 80% of respondents believe that corporal punishment has been effective in deterring crime. Therefore, there's a need to consider implementing corporal punishment based on these empirical evidences."

It can also help prepare them for environments where dress standards are non-negotiable, fostering a sense of compliance and respect for rules."

Actually, Mr. Vice President, its not true. I do support a national patients bill of rights. As a matter of fact, I brought Republicans and Democrats together to do just that in the State of Texas to get a patients bill of rights through. It requires a different kind of leadership style to do it, though. You see, in order to get something done on behalf of the people, you have to put partisanship aside, and thats what we did in my state. We have one of the most advanced patients bill of rights. It says, for example, that a woman doesnt have to go through a gate keeper to go to her gynecologist. It says that you cant gag a doctor, doctor can advise you. The HMO, the insurance company, cant gag that doctor from giving you full advice. And this particular bill, it allows patients to choose a doctor, their own doctor if they want to. But we did something else that was interesting. Were one of the first states that said you can sue an HMO for denying you proper coverage. Now theres whats called an Independent Review Organization that you have to go through first. It says if you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got a complaint with your insurance company, you can take your complaint to an objective body. If the objective body rules on your behalf, the insurance company must follow those rules. However, if the insurance company doesnt follow the findings of the IRO, then that becomes a cause of action in a court of law. Its time for our nation to come together and do whats right for the people, and I think this is right for the people. You know, I support a national patients bill of rights, Mr. Vice President, and I want all people covered. I dont want the law to supersede good law like weve got in Texas. I think \u2014"

While diplomacy and conflict resolution are crucial, they may not always guarantee immediate or effective solutions. In some cases, the presence of a deterrent can provide a necessary backup to ensure national security and deter aggression, ultimately contributing to global stability by preventing conflicts from escalating."

Legalizing polygamy doesn't mean endorsing chaos or discord in relationships. Instead, it provides an opportunity for those who can balance love and commitment with more than one partner. Moreover, it's about respect for individual freedom and diversity in love, which could promote acceptance and understanding in society."
