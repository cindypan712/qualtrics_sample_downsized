The only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies, but I would also support a law in the Congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing. I just \u2014 I think that racial profiling is a serious problem. I remember when the stories first came out about the stops in New Jersey by the highway patrol there. And I know its been going on a long time. In some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years. But I have to confess that it was the first time that I really focused on it in a new way. And I was surprised at the extent of it. And I think weve now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this. Imagine what it \u2014 what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly, unjustly, and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity. Now, that runs counter to what the United States of America is all about at our core. And its not an easy problem to solve. But if I am entrusted with the presidency, it will be the first Civil Rights Act of the 21st century."

Furthermore, it can enhance workforce productivity by helping individuals with opioid use disorders return to work. Also, while private sector collaboration can help, public funding ensures stable, long-term support for these programs."

Additionally, impeachment does not guarantee removal from office, which could lead to wasted time and resources. Also, it may result in increased political polarization, which could hinder future cooperation and compromise."

One of the serious problems, hear me well, is that our system of government is being undermined by too much influence coming from special interest money. We have to get a handle on it. And like John McCain, I have learned from experience, and its not a new position for me. 24 years ago I supported full public financing of all federal elections. And anybody who thinks Im just saying it, it will be the first bill I send to the Congress. I want you to know I care passionately about this and I will fight until it becomes law."

By maintaining this process, we ensure that universities admit students who are most likely to excel in their academic pursuits and contribute positively to the campus community. This is supported by data showing that students admitted through rigorous admissions processes tend to have higher graduation rates and are more likely to secure high-paying jobs after graduation."
