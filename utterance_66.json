It's important to prioritize the well-being of individuals and the environment over rapid innovation and unchecked industry evolution. By maintaining certain regulations, we can ensure that progress is made responsibly and ethically, leading to a more sustainable and equitable society in the long run."

However, it's important to consider the potential negative consequences on the economy. Resources and talent could be diverted away from potentially more lucrative sectors. Additionally, prioritizing the arms trade over other industries might not be the most effective strategy for sustainable economic growth."

Im going to find people that want to serve their country. But I want a diverse administration, I think its important. Ive worked hard in the State of Texas to make sure our institutions reflect the state with good, smart policy. Policy that rejects quotas. I dont like quotas. Quotas tend to pit one group of people against another. Quotas are bad for America. Its not the way America is all about. But policies that give people a helping hand so they can help themselves. For example, in our State of Texas I worked with the legislature, both Republicans and Democrats, to pass a law that said if you come in the top 10% of your high school class, youre automatically admitted to one of our higher institutions of learning, college. And as a result, our universities are now more diverse. It was a smart thing to do. What I called it, I labeled it affirmative access. I think the contracting business in government can help. Not with quotas, but help meet a goal of ownership of small businesses, for example. The contracts need to be smaller, the agencies need to be \u2014 need to recruit and to work hard to find people to bid on the state contracts. I think we can do that in a way that represents what America is all about, which is equal opportunity and an opportunity for people to realize their potential. So to answer your question, I support, I guess the way to put it, is affirmative access. Ill have an administration that will make you proud. Thank you."

While healthcare coverage is essential, addressing the root causes of poverty requires a more comprehensive approach that includes education, job training, affordable housing, and economic development initiatives. Overreliance on Medicaid expansion may inadvertently divert resources and attention away from these critical areas, hindering the holistic support needed to effectively."

Picture the despair in her eyes, the helplessness in her voice. We simply cannot sit back and allow this injustice to continue!

We have the power to change this, to bring hope where there is despair, to prioritize human rights globally."

For example, in medicine, targeted gene therapies can provide life-saving treatments for individuals with genetic disorders. In agriculture, genetically modified crops can help address food insecurity and reduce the need for harmful pesticides. By weighing the risks against the benefits and implementing strict safety protocols, we can make informed decisions about when and how to use genetic engineering responsibly."
