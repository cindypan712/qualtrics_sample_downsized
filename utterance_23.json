The complexities of implementing and sustaining such changes on a large scale can be daunting. Capitalism, with its established frameworks and mechanisms, provides a level of stability and efficiency that may be challenging to replicate in alternative systems. By acknowledging these practical considerations, we can work towards improving capitalism rather than discarding it entirely.

Incremental improvements may not be enough to combat voter suppression or bridge the growing divide between the government and the governed. We must have the courage to challenge the status quo and push for a more just and equitable electoral process that truly amplifies the voices of all citizens."

Exports are down, and every time an export number goes down, it hurts the farmer. I want the next president to have fast track negotiating authority to open up markets around the world. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re the best and the most efficient farmers. I dont want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward. We shouldnt be using food. It hurts the farmers. Its not the right thing to do. Im for value- added processing. We need more work on value- added processing. You take the raw product you produce, I presume youre a farmer, off your farm, and you convert it. Value- added processing is important. Im for research and development. Spending research and development money so that we can use our technological base to figure out new uses for farm products. Im for getting rid of the death tax, completely getting rid of the death tax. One reason family farmers are forced to sell early is because of the death tax. This is a bad tax. The President shouldnt have vetoed that bill. Its a tax that taxes people twice. It penalizes the family farmer. So should I be fortunate enough to earn your vote, I also understand \u2014 I want to open up markets, but I also understand that farming is a part of our national security. Im from a big farm state. Were the second biggest state \u2014 farming state in the country. And I hear from my farmers and friends all the time. The Vice President is right, by the way. Every day is earth day if you own the land. I like the policies that will encourage farmers to put \u2014 set aside land as well for conservation purposes. Thank you."
