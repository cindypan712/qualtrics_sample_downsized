We can address food insecurity and promote healthy eating habits without further government intervention. It's about finding other effective solutions that do not involve expanding the role of the federal government."

Over-reliance on technology may lead to decreased critical thinking skills, limited social interaction, and potential security risks. Traditional teaching methods also play a crucial role in building a strong foundation of knowledge and skills in students. It's essential to strike a balance between utilizing technology and preserving traditional teaching approaches for a well-rounded education."

However, I believe that appropriate education and awareness could mitigate these risks. If we lower the drinking age but also implement robust alcohol education programs, we can ensure that young adults make informed decisions about alcohol, much like they do when voting or joining the military. This approach aligns with societal norms and values of personal responsibility and informed choices."

Striking a balance between activism and academic excellence is essential."

By emphasizing the importance of both academic achievement and student well-being, we can create a more holistic approach to education that nurtures students."
