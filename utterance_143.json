It stings my heart to imagine a society where we carelessly disregard the rights and protections of the unborn. We're not just playing with personal choices, we're tampering with the delicate fabric of life itself! The ethical implications cast a dark, ominous shadow over every decision, and we must not ignore it. We must protect all lives involved, the mother and the unborn child"

Not only would it threaten Israel, our strongest ally in the region and one of our strongest allies in the world, but it would also create a possibility of nuclear weapons falling into the hands of terrorists. And so its unacceptable. And I will do everything thats required to prevent it. And we will never take military options off the table. And it is important that we dont provide veto power to the United Nations or anyone else in acting in our interests. It is important, though, for us to use all the tools at our disposal to prevent the scenario where weve got to make those kinds of choices. And thats why I have consistently said that, if we can work more effectively with other countries diplomatically to tighten sanctions on Iran, if we can reduce our energy consumption through alternative energy, so that Iran has less money, if we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though its an oil- producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing their cost- benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on them. Now, it is true, though, that I believe that we should have direct talks \u2014 not just with our friends, but also with our enemies \u2014 to deliver a tough, direct message to Iran that, if you dont change your behavior, then there will be dire consequences. If you do change your behavior, then it is possible for you to re- join the community of nations. Now, it may not work. But one of the things weve learned is, is that when we take that approach, whether its in North Korea or in Iran, then we have a better chance at better outcomes. When President Bush decided were not going to talk to Iran, were not going to talk to North Korea, you know what happened? Iran went from zero centrifuges to develop nuclear weapons to 4, 000. North Korea quadrupled its nuclear capability. Weve got to try to have talks, understanding that were not taking military options off the table."
