And as for why it happened, Im no expert on the Texas procedures, but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by Democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered. And instead directed the money toward a tax cut, a significant part of which went to wealthy interests. He declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in Texas an emergency need, and so the money was taken away from the CHIP program. Theres \u2014 you dont have to take my word for this. There is now a federal judges opinion about the current management of this program ordering the State of Texas to do \u2014 you should read that judges language about this. I believe there are 1. 4 million children in Texas who do not have health insurance. 600, 000 of whom, and maybe some of those have since gotten it, but as of a year ago 600, 000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldnt sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up."

I know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations. But the fact is that thats the situation that was left when I got there. And we have maintained the sanctions. Now I want to go further. I want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow Saddam Hussein, and I know there are allegations that theyre too weak to do it, but thats what they said about the forces that were opposing Milosevic in Serbia, and you know, the policy of enforcing sanctions against Serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week, and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there, building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former Soviet Union in the communist block, seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions. I know the governors not necessarily saying that but, you know, all of these flights that have come in, all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime, Im told, except for three where they notified, and theyre trying to break out of the box, theres no question about it. I dont think they should be allowed to."

The existing bail system is costly and resource-intensive, often requiring significant manpower for administration and oversight. By shifting to alternative methods such as risk assessments and supervision programs, we may be able to reduce these costs. Additionally, alternative methods can potentially lead to less overcrowding in jails, which is a practical concern for many jurisdictions. It's a matter of efficiency and fiscal responsibility."
