By incorporating subjects like history, literature, and the arts into STEM education, students can develop a holistic understanding of complex issues and foster creativity and innovation. This interdisciplinary approach not only strengthens students' knowledge base but also cultivates critical thinking skills and empathy.

Without the assurance of re-election, lawmakers may not invest in initiatives that take longer than their term to bear fruit. Moreover, term limits could also lead to a loss of experienced legislators who have a deep understanding of complex policy issues. This could negatively impact the quality of legislation."

When approached thoughtfully and in a structured manner, student activism can enhance the overall educational experience by encouraging students to apply their learning to real-world"
