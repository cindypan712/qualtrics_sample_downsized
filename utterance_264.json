Whether or not you have the capacity to convince people to follow? Whether or not one makes decisions based on sound principles or whether or not you rely upon polls and focus groups on how to decide what the course of action is. We have too much polling and focus groups going on in Washington today. We need decisions made on sound principles. Ive been the governor of a big state. I think one of the hallmarks of my relationship in Austin, Texas, is that Ive had the capacity to work with both Republicans and Democrats. I think thats an important part of leadership. I think what it means to build consensus. Ive shown I know how to do so. Tonight in the audience theres one elected state senator who is a Democrat, a former state- wide officer who is a Democrat, a lot of Democrats who are here in the debate to \u2014 because they want to show their support that shows I know how to lead. And so the fundamental answer to your question, who can lead and whos shown the ability to get things done?"

By offering them access to essential services, we can empower them to become productive members of society, contributing to the economy and overall well-being of the community. Moreover, addressing the needs of all children, regardless of their immigration status, aligns with principles of equality and human rights."

While some ethical productions exist, they are overshadowed by harmful content perpetuating damaging stereotypes and behaviors. Allowing this proliferation risks normalizing exploitation and violence as acceptable sexuality expressions. Prioritizing individuals' well-being and safety over the dissemination of potentially harmful material is essential."

The content we share and consume should be governed by a moral and ethical compass - the idea of right and wrong. Streaming violent acts, in my opinion, crosses that line of ethics. It's not about the potential impact, but rather the principle of the matter. It feels fundamentally inappropriate to allow such content to be freely accessible."

Parents are teaching their children right from wrong, and the message oftentimes gets undermined by the popular culture. You bet theres things that government can do. We can work with the entertainment industry to provide family hour. We can have filters on Internets where public money is spent. There ought to be filters in public libraries and filters in public schools so if kids get on the Internet, there is not going to be pornography or violence coming in. I think we ought to have character education in our schools. I know that doesnt directly talk about Hollywood, but it does reinforce the values youre teaching. Greatly expand character education funding so that public schools will teach children values, values which have stood the test of time. Theres afterschool money available. I think that afterschool money ought to be available for faith- based programs and charitable programs that exist because somebody has heard the call to love a neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself. That will help reinforce the values that parents teach at home as well. Ours is a great land, and one of the reasons why is because were free. And so I dont support censorship. But I do believe that we ought to talk plainly to the Hollywood moguls and people who produce this stuff and explain the consequences. I think we need to have rating systems that are clear. I happen to like the idea of having technology for the TV, easy for parents to use so you can tune out these programs you dont want in your house. Ill remind mothers and dads the best weapon is the off/on button, and paying attention to your children, and eating dinner with them and being \u2014 Im sorry. I was on my peroration."

While the promise of safety and efficiency with self-driving cars is enticing, the emotional weight of trusting machines with such responsibility is still a heavy burden to bear. It's a challenging issue that requires thoughtful reflection and thorough examination of all possible outcomes before fully embracing it."

While efficiency is important, it should not come at the expense of ethical considerations and the well-being of workers and consumers. Upholding ethical standards and promoting social responsibility should be prioritized alongside economic prosperity to create a more sustainable and equitable society."

Rather than focusing on expanding, let's consider the value that the EPA already brings in its present form. It's essential to remain cautious about increasing the power and scope of such agencies."
