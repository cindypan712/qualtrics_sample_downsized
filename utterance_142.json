It suggests that every person, irrespective of their financial capabilities, should have access to basic health services. Rather than seeing them as conflicting, we can view both principles as different facets of a well-rounded health care system."

And it is true that this is going to be, I think, one of the most consequential decisions of the next president. It is very likely that one of us will be making at least one and probably more than one appointments and Roe versus Wade probably hangs in the balance. Now I would not provide a litmus test. But I am somebody who believes that Roe versus Wade was rightly decided. I think that abortion is a very difficult issue and it is a moral issue and one that I think good people on both sides can disagree on.

By studying successful universal healthcare models in countries with diverse healthcare systems, policymakers can tailor and implement strategies that are suitable for their specific circumstances.

Ive actually passed 56 individual bills that Ive personally written and, in addition to that, and not always under my name, there is amendments on certain bills. But more importantly, with respect to the question of no record, I helped write \u2014 I did write, I was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s. And Im very proud of that. So the presidents wrong."
