The inherent drive for profit maximization can lead to unethical practices, such as exploitation of workers, environmental degradation, and prioritizing short-term gains over long-term sustainability.

And, by the way, this was a proposal made by Senator Clinton not too long ago. So, obviously, if we can start increasing home values, then there will be creation of wealth."

Focusing solely on corporate corruption may divert resources and attention from more critical matters such as income inequality, climate change, or public health. These issues have far-reaching consequences that impact society as a whole, and addressing them should be our top priority to create a more equitable and sustainable future. By tackling these fundamental challenges first, we can lay a stronger foundation for addressing corporate corruption in the long run."
