While there may be a correlation between stricter gun laws and lower gun-related deaths in certain states, it doesn't necessarily prove that the regulations directly caused the decrease in violence. Other factors such as socioeconomic conditions, education, and access to mental health services can also play significant roles in influencing crime rates.

There have been instances of abuse of power, infringement of civil liberties, and lack of accountability within the FBI. It is crucial to balance the need for law enforcement with the protection of individual rights and freedoms. As a society, we have a moral obligation to ensure that our actions, including supporting government agencies, align with principles of fairness."

The challenges that we face are unprecedented. Americans are hurting tonight in a way they have not in our generation. There are challenges around the world that are new and different and there will be different \u2014 we will be talking about countries sometime in the future that we hardly know where they are on the map, some Americans. So what I dont know is what the unexpected will be. But I have spent my whole life serving this country. I grew up in a family where my father was gone most of the time because he was at sea and doing our countrys business. My mother basically raised our family. I know what its like in dark times. I know what its like to have to fight to keep ones hope going through difficult times. I know what its like to rely on others for support and courage and love in tough times. I know what its like to have your comrades reach out to you and your neighbors and your fellow citizens and pick you up and put you back in the fight. Thats what Americas all about. I believe in this country. I believe in its future. I believe in its greatness. Its been my great honor to serve it for many, many years. And Im asking the American people to give me another opportunity and Ill rest on my record, but Ill also tell you, when times are tough, we need a steady hand at the tiller and the great honor of my life was to always put my country first. Thank you, Tom."
