Education and age restrictions are important steps, but they may not be sufficient to shield individuals, especially the vulnerable, from the negative impact of exploitative and violent content. It's crucial to prioritize the well-being and safety of individuals, particularly children, by taking a more proactive approach to limit the proliferation of harmful material rather than relying solely on reactive measures."

We just have a different philosophy. Let me talk about tax relief. If you pay taxes, you ought to get tax relief. The Vice President believes only the right people ought to get tax relief. I dont think thats the role of the president to pick youre right and youre not right. I think if youre going to have tax relief, everybody ought to get it. And therefore, wealthy people are going to get it. But the top 1% will end up paying one- third of the taxes in America and they get one- fifth of the benefits. And thats because we structured the plan so that six million additional American families pay no taxes. If youre a family of four making $50, 000 in Missouri, you get a 50% cut in your federal income taxes. What Ive done is set priorities and funded them. And theres extra money. And I believe the people who pay the bills ought to get some money back. Its a difference of opinion. He wants to grow the government and I trust you with your own money. I wish we could spend an hour talking about trusting people. Its just the right position to take."

By focusing on broader systemic changes such as improving access to affordable healthcare and implementing policies that support family well-being holistically, we can create a more sustainable impact on children's lives. Research indicates that addressing social determinants of health, such as income inequality and housing instability, can have far-reaching benefits for children across various domains."

        "text": "Very much so. Let me pay a compliment to the president, if I may. I think in those days after 9/11, I thought the president did a terrific job. And I really was moved, as well as impressed, by the speech that he gave to the Congress. And I think the hug Tom Daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no Democrats, no Republicans, we were all just Americans. Thats where we were. Thats not where we are today. I regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter, not a divider, is now presiding over the most divided America in the recent memory of our country. Ive never seen such ideological squabbles in the Congress of the United States. Ive never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way theyre locked out today. We have to change that. And as president, I am committed to changing that. I dont care if the idea comes from the other side or this side. I think we have to come together and work to change it. And Ive done that. Over 20 years in the United States Senate, Ive worked with John McCain, whos sitting here, Ive worked with other colleagues. Ive reached across the aisle. Ive tried to find the common ground, because thats what makes us strong as Americans. And if Americans trust me with the presidency, I can pledge to you, we will have the most significant effort, openly \u2014 not secret meetings in the White House with special interests, not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside \u2014 but a genuine effort to try to restore Americas hope and possibilities by bringing people together. And one of the ways were going to do it is, Im going to work with my friend, John McCain, to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people, so America is really represented by the people who make up America."
