Only the United States put the sanctions on alone, and thats exactly what Im talking about. In order for the sanctions to be effective, we should have been working with the British, French and Germans and other countries. And thats the difference between the president and me. And there, again, he sort of slid by the question. Now, with respect to Darfur, yes, it is a genocide. And months ago, many of us were pressing for action. I think the reason that were not saying send American troops in at this point is severalfold. Number one, we can do this through the African Union, providing we give them the logistical support. Right now all the president is providing is humanitarian support. We need to do more than that. Theyve got to have the logistical capacity to go in and stop the killing. And thats going to require more than is on the table today. I also believe that it is \u2014 one of the reasons we cant do it is were overextended. Ask the people in the armed forces today. Weve got Guards and Reserves who are doing double duties. Weve got a backdoor draft taking place in America today; people with stop- loss programs where theyre told you cant get out of the military; nine out of our 10 active duty divisions committed to Iraq one way or the other, either going, coming or preparing. So this is the way the president has overextended the United States. Thats why, in my plan, I add two active duty divisions to the United States Army, not for Iraq, but for our general demands across the globe. I also intend to double the number of special forces so that we can do the job we need to do with respect fighting the terrorists around the world. And if we do that, then we have the ability to be able to respond more rapidly. But Ill tell you this, as president, if it took American forces to some degree to coalesce the African Union, Id be prepared to do it because we could never allow another Rwanda. Its a moral responsibility for us and the world."

By providing autonomy and trust to employees, organizations can empower them to manage their workloads effectively and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Additionally, offering support resources such as mental health programs, flexible scheduling options, and virtual team-building activities can help mitigate the negative impacts on employee well-being. Ultimately, a thoughtful and strategic approach to flexible workplaces"

It's essential to explore alternative approaches that can achieve the goal of improving healthcare access without compromising on efficiency, innovation, and individual choice in healthcare decision-making. We should carefully evaluate the potential trade-offs and implications of different policy options before making a decision on expanding Medicare access."

Hunting can have negative consequences on ecosystems and biodiversity. For instance, it can disrupt natural food chains and lead to imbalances in the ecosystem, affecting not just the hunted species but also other interconnected species. Additionally, hunting can contribute to the decline of endangered species if not carefully regulated. Therefore, it is crucial to explore alternative methods of wildlife population control that do not involve killing animals for sport or recreation."

By opening up trade barriers, we can access new markets, increase efficiency through specialization, and attract foreign investment. This can lead to economic growth, job creation, and overall prosperity for the country. What are your thoughts on this perspective?"

It is a measure aimed at providing equal opportunity for those who wish to pursue tertiary education. This could lead to a diverse workforce with a broad range of skills and competencies. Therefore, considering the potential benefits, it may be worth exploring this avenue further."

Everybody who was around then, and had been there, and knew about it knew that it was a failed state. But let me tell you, you know, this business about bombing Iran and all that, let me tell you my record. Back in 1983, when I was a brand- new United States congressman, the one \u2014 the person I admired the most and still admire the most, Ronald Reagan, wanted to send Marines into Lebanon. And I saw that, and I saw the situation, and I stood up, and I voted against that, because I was afraid that they couldnt make peace in a place where 300 or 400 or several hundred Marines would make a difference. Tragically, I was right; Nearly 300 Marines lost their lives in the bombing of the barracks. And then we had Somalia \u2014 then we had the first Gulf War. I supported \u2014 I supported that. I supported us going into Bosnia, when a number of my own party and colleagues was against that operation in Bosnia. That was the right thing to do, to stop genocide and to preserve what was necessary inside of Europe. I supported what we did in Kosovo. I supported it because ethnic cleansing and genocide was taking place there. And I have a record \u2014 and Somalia, I opposed that we should turn \u2014 turn the force in Somalia from a peacekeeping force into a peacemaking force, which they were not capable of. So I have a record. I have a record of being involved in these national security issues, which involve the highest responsibility and the toughest decisions that any president can make, and that is to send our young men and women into harms way. And Ill tell you, I had a town hall meeting in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, and a woman stood up and she said, \u201cSenator McCain, I want you to do me the honor of wearing a bracelet with my sons name on it. \u201d He was 22 years old and he was killed in combat outside of Baghdad, Matthew Stanley, before Christmas last year. This was last August, a year ago. And I said, \u201cI will \u2014 I will wear his bracelet with honor. \u201d And this was August, a year ago. And then she said, \u201cBut, Senator McCain, I want you to do everything \u2014 promise me one thing, that youll do everything in your power to make sure that my sons death was not in vain. \u201d That means that that mission succeeds, just like those young people who re- enlisted in Baghdad, just like the mother I met at the airport the other day whose son was killed. And they all say to me that we dont want defeat. I know what that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s like when an army is defeated."
