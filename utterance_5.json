And, like Franklin Roosevelt, I dont care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea. I just care whether it works for America and whether its going to make us stronger. These are dangerous times. I believe I offer tested, strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world. And I believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of Americans. We can lift our schools up. We can create jobs that pay more than the jobs were losing overseas. We can have health care for all Americans. We can further the cause of equality in our nation. Let me just make it clear; I will never allow any country to have a veto over our security. Just as I fought for our country as a young man, with the same passion I will fight to defend this nation that I love. And, with faith in God and with conviction in the mission of America, I believe that we can reach higher. I believe we can do better. I think the greatest possibilities of our country, our dreams and our hopes, are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them. And I ask you to embark on that journey with me. I ask you for your trust. I ask you for your help. I ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours, of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and, most of all, to be safer forever. Thank you. Goodnight. And God bless the United States of America."

This is not because I fear potential negative effects, but because I strongly believe in the importance of human touch in all sectors. Using drones may seem impressive, but it does not hold the same level of human interaction and involvement."

First of all on the issue of partial birth or so- called late- term abortion, I would sign a law banning that procedure, provided that doctors have the ability to save a womans life or to act if her health is severely at risk. Thats not the main issue. The main issue is whether or not the Roe v. Wade decision is going to be overturned. I support a womans right to choose. My opponent does not. It is important because the next president is going to appoint three and maybe even four justices of the Supreme Court. And Governor Bush has declared to the anti- choice groups that he will appoint justices in the mold of Scalia and Clarence Thomas, who are known for being the most vigorous opponents of a womans right to choose. Here is the difference. He trusts the government to order a woman to do what it thinks she ought to do. I trust women to make the decisions that affect their lives, their destinies and their bodies. And I think a womans right to choose ought to be protected and defended."

Pardons and commutations provide immediate relief to individuals who may not have been reached by broader systemic reforms yet. By utilizing presidential clemency powers, urgent cases of injustice can be addressed, while systemic reforms prevent future injustices. This dual approach creates a more comprehensive and impactful strategy to promote fairness and equity within the justice system."
