By investing more resources in these programs, we can provide better access to treatment and support for individuals struggling with opioid addiction. This, in turn, can help reduce overdose-related deaths and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems. What are your thoughts on this issue?"

By focusing solely on Native American rights, we may inadvertently neglect the needs of other vulnerable populations who are also deserving of support and resources. It is essential to strive for justice and equality for all, taking into account the greater good of society."

If we had done what Senator Obama wanted done in Iraq, and that was set a date for withdrawal, which General Petraeus, our chief \u2014 chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff said would be a very dangerous course to take for America, then we would have had a wider war, we would have been back, Iranian influence would have increased, al Qaeda would have re- established a base. There was a lot at stake there, my friends. And I can tell you right now that Senator Obama would have brought our troops home in defeat. Ill bring them home with victory and with honor and that is a fundamental difference. The United States of America, Tom, is the greatest force for good, as I said. And we must do whatever we can to prevent genocide, whatever we can to prevent these terrible calamities that we have said never again. But it also has to be tempered with our ability to beneficially affect the situation. That requires a cool hand at the tiller. This requires a person who understands what our \u2014 the limits of our capability are. We went in to Somalia as a peacemaking organization, we ended up trying to be \u2014 excuse me, as a peacekeeping organization, we ended up trying to be peacemakers and we ended up having to withdraw in humiliation. In Lebanon, I stood up to President Reagan, my hero, and said, if we send Marines in there, how can we possibly beneficially affect this situation? And said we shouldnt. Unfortunately, almost 300 brave young Marines were killed. So you have to temper your decisions with the ability to beneficially affect the situation and realize youre sending Americas most precious asset, American blood, into harms way. And, again, I know those situations. Ive been in them all my life. And I can tell you right now the security of your young men and women who are serving in the military are my first priority right after our nations security. And I may have to make those tough decisions. But I wont take them lightly. And I understand that we have to say never again to a Holocaust and never again to Rwanda. But we had also better be darn sure we dont leave and make the situation worse, thereby exacerbating our reputation and our ability to address crises in other parts of the world."

By having a standardized measure, it ensures consistency in assessing students from different backgrounds and schools. It also helps identify areas where students may need additional support or enrichment. A combination of standardized testing and other assessment methods can offer a more well-rounded view of a student's abilities."
