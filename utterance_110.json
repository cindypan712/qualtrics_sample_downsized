And if you make less than $250, 000, less than a quarter- million dollars a year, then you will not see one dimes worth of tax increase. Now, John mentioned the fact that business taxes on paper are high in this country, and hes absolutely right. Heres the problem; There are so many loopholes that have been written into the tax code, oftentimes with support of Senator McCain, that we actually see our businesses pay effectively one of the lowest tax rates in the world. And what that means, then, is that there are people out there who are working every day, who are not getting a tax cut, and you want to give them more. Its not like you want to close the loopholes. You just want to add an additional tax cut over the loopholes. And thats a problem. Just one last point I want to make, since Senator McCain talked about providing a $5, 000 health credit. Now, what he doesnt tell you is that he intends to, for the first time in history, tax health benefits. So you may end up getting a $5, 000 tax credit. Heres the only problem; Your employer now has to pay taxes on the health care that youre getting from your employer. And if you end up losing your health care from your employer, youve got to go out on the open market and try to buy it. It is not a good deal for the American people. But its an example of this notion that the market can always solve everything and that the less regulation we have, the better off were going to be."

Different schools and universities have varying resources, student populations, and organizational structures that could impact their ability to comply with strict Title IX regulations. By allowing for some flexibility in enforcement, institutions can better navigate these complexities and ensure that they can effectively promote equality while also addressing their unique circumstances."

One of the reasons I regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that I was trying to make. However many days that young girl in Florida stood in her classroom, however long, even if it was only one day, doesnt change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in America and we need to do something about that. There are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people, more than their pets, sometimes. More sometimes than people in foreign countries. And we need to do something about that. Not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next presidents term of four years is over. But right away. And that means doing it under the Medicare program. I cant promise that I will never get another detail wrong. I can promise you that I will try not to, and hard. But I will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world, that I will do my best if Im elected president, Ill work my heart out to get the big things right for the American people."

Now, imagine a world where politics and media work hand in hand, shining a light on those decisions, giving us a voice, and creating a sense of unity and understanding. Doesn't your heart swell with hope at the thought of such transparency?"

Simply returning land without addressing the complexities of governance, economic development, and community relationships could result in unintended negative outcomes. It is essential to approach land rights issues with a balanced perspective that takes into account the needs and concerns of all stakeholders involved. Sustainable solutions that promote cooperation, mutual respect, and shared prosperity among diverse groups are key to building a more inclusive and harmonious society"
