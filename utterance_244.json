While diversity can bring valuable perspectives and skills, it's essential to carefully assess the impact of significant policy changes on unit cohesion and operational effectiveness. Prioritizing the mission readiness and overall effectiveness of the military is paramount in making decisions that may impact its core functions."

Prioritizing deficit reduction alongside strategic investments can help prevent excessive government debt accumulation, which could burden future generations and limit our ability to respond to unforeseen economic challenges. By carefully managing both deficit reduction and investments, we can create a more resilient and prosperous economy for years to come. How do you think we can ensure that"

The potential benefits you mention, like extending and improving lives, could indeed be revolutionary.

He just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get. That costs the government $7, 700 per family. If every family in America signed up, like the senator suggested, if would cost us $5 trillion over 10 years. Its an empty promise. Its called bait and switch."
