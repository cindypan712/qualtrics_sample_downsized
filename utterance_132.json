This race is about values, its about change, its about giving choices to the American people. And education is my number one priority, because I think that its the most important big major change that we can bring in our country. I agree with Governor Bush that we should have new accountability, testing of students. I think that we should require states to test all students, test schools and school districts, and I think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also. The difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control, it doesnt stop there. Because I want to give new choices to parents. To send their kids to college with a $10, 000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year. I want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country. For one basic reason, so that students can get more one- on- one time with teachers. And the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers. Ive a plan in my budget to recruit 100, 000 new, highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools. I think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and pre- school. Now, here is how that connects with all the rest of what weve been talking about. If you have \u2014 if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top, then you cant make education the top priority. If the tax cut is your number one, two, three and four priority, you cant do education. You cant do both. You have to choose. I choose education and health care, the environment and retirement security, and I ask for your support."

Rather than focusing on impeachment, we should instead concentrate on the merits of the existing administration. It is important to strive for unity and progress, rather than division."

There's also a component of representation and diversity to consider. Instead of outright dismissal, perhaps we could examine it in a broader context. There could be aspects we've overlooked."

By limiting the overall encouragement of video games, we can send a message to developers that the well-being of players should come first. Additionally, by promoting alternative activities that offer similar cognitive and economic benefits without the potential risks associated with gaming, we can create a more"

For instance, the study published in the Journal of Peace Research found that regulations often create a black market for arms, exacerbating the problem. Additionally, the Global Arms Trade Transparency Report indicates that despite regulations, many arms-exporting countries fail to fully disclose their arms sales. Therefore, it seems that regulation doesn't effectively mitigate the negative impacts of the arms trade on global security and stability."

There's a concept in nutrition science known as \"energy density\", which refers to the amount of energy (or calories) per unit volume of food. Junk food, being high in energy density, can provide quick energy. Also, a strict ban on junk food can lead to a lack of variety in the diet, which is also not ideal. Therefore, a balance"

Let me talk to you about an important aspect of this issue. We have to change the culture of America. Those of us who are proudly pro- life understand that. And its got to be courage and compassion that we show to a young woman whos facing this terribly difficult decision. Senator Obama, as a member of the Illinois State Senate, voted in the Judiciary Committee against a law that would provide immediate medical attention to a child born of a failed abortion. He voted against that. And then, on the floor of the State Senate, as he did 130 times as a state senator, he voted present. Then there was another bill before the Senate Judiciary Committee in the state of Illinois not that long ago, where he voted against a ban on partial- birth abortion, one of the late- term abortion, a really \u2014 one of the bad procedures, a terrible. And then, on the floor of the Illinois State Senate, he voted present. I dont know how you vote \u201cpresent\u201d on some of that. I dont know how you align yourself with the extreme aspect of the pro- abortion movement in America. And thats his record, and thats a matter of his record. And hell say it has something to do with Roe v. Wade, about the Illinois State Senate. It was clear- cut votes that Senator Obama voted, I think, in direct contradiction to the feelings and views of mainstream America."
