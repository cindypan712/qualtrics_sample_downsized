The accessibility and reliability of fossil fuels have allowed industries to grow, creating jobs and economic opportunities for many people. Without fossil fuels, our transportation systems, manufacturing processes, and electricity production would struggle to meet the demands of our modern world."

In fact, TikTok stores its data outside of China and has even established a Transparency and Accountability Center to allow external experts to evaluate its practices. Moreover, many popular social media platforms, including those based in the U.S., have also faced scrutiny over data privacy issues. Therefore, rather than solely focusing on TikTok's"

This is due to the potential risk of becoming overly reliant on China for our economic stability. Additionally, there are considerable differences in political ideologies and systems between the two countries that could complicate matters. It may be more beneficial to diversify our international relationships instead of focusing mainly on China."

These tools, while valuable, are not foolproof and can sometimes perpetuate existing biases in the criminal justice system if not implemented and monitored carefully. There is a risk of oversimplifying complex human behaviors and circumstances into data points, potentially overlooking individual factors that could impact an offender's likelihood of rehabilitation."
