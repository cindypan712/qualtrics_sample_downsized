This stance is not about the potential consequences of increased spending. It's about adhering to a principle of financial responsibility and discipline. We should prioritize fiscal sustainability above expansion of government spending."

Right now, in the United States of America, business pays the second- highest business taxes in the world, 35 percent. Ireland pays 11 percent. Now, if youre a business person, and you can locate any place in the world, then, obviously, if you go to the country where its 11 percent tax versus 35 percent, youre going to be able to create jobs, increase your business, make more investment, et cetera. I want to cut that business tax. I want to cut it so that businesses will remain in \u2014 in the United States of America and create jobs. But, again, I want to return. Its a lot more than $18 billion in pork- barrel spending. I can tell you, its rife. Its throughout. The United States Senate will take up a continuing resolution tomorrow or the next day, sometime next week, with 2, 000 \u2014 2, 000 \u2014 look at them, my friends. Look at them. Youll be appalled. And Senator Obama is a recent convert, after requesting $932 million worth of pork- barrel spending projects. So the point is, I want people to have tax cuts. I want every family to have a $5, 000 refundable tax credit so they can go out and purchase their own health care. I want to double the dividend from $3, 500 to $7, 000 for every dependent child in America. I know that the worst thing we could possibly do is to raise taxes on anybody, and a lot of people might be interested in Senator Obamas definition of \u201crich. \u201d"

It's essential to carefully weigh the potential cost savings against the financial burden of expanding coverage to a larger population. Additionally, we must consider the potential implications on healthcare providers and their ability to meet the increased demand for services. It's crucial to ensure that any expansion of Medicare is sustainable and does not inadvertently create new challenges for the healthcare system as a whole."

And four years ago they campaigned on getting prescription drugs for seniors. And now theyre campaigning on getting prescription drugs for seniors. It seems like they cant get it done. Now, they may blame other folks, but its time to get somebody in Washington who is going to work with both Republicans and Democrats to get some positive things done when it comes to our seniors. And so what Ive said is that theres been some missed opportunities. Theyve had a chance. Theyve had a chance to form consensus. Ive got a plan on Medicare, for example, thats a two- stage plan that says well have immediate help for seniors and what I call immediate Helping Hand, a $48 billion program. But I also want to say to seniors, if youre happy with Medicare the way it is, fine, you can stay in the program. But were going to give you additional choices like they give federal employees in the federal employee health plan. They have a variety of choices to choose, so should seniors. And my point has been, as opposed to politicizing an issue like Medicare, in other words, holding it up as an issue, hoping somebody bites it and try to clobber them over the head with it for political purposes, this year, in the year 2000, its time to get it done once and for all. Thats what Ive been critical about the administration for. Same with Social Security. I think there was a good opportunity to bring Republicans and Democrats together to reform the Social Security system so seniors will never go without. Those on Social Security today will have their promise made, but also to give younger workers the option at their choice of being able to manage some of their own money in the private sector to make sure theres a Social Security system around tomorrow. There are a lot of young workers at our rallies we go to that when they hear Ill trust them at their option to be able to manage, under certain guidelines, some of their own money to get a better rate of return so that theyll have a retirement plan in the future, they begin to nod their heads and they want a different attitude in Washington."

Prohibiting marijuana has led to a range of negative consequences, such as disproportionate enforcement in marginalized communities, fueling of illegal drug markets, and hindering access to medical treatment for those in need. By legalizing and regulating marijuana, we can address these ethical issues and create a more just and equitable society for all individuals, balancing personal freedoms with societal well-being."
