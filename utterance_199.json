Weve got an energy bill on the Senate floor right now that contains some good stuff, some stuff you want, including drilling off- shore, but youre opposed to it because it would strip away those tax breaks that have gone to oil companies."

For instance, there are various alternative strategies like timeouts, grounding, or loss of privileges. Corporal punishment is just one method among many, and not necessarily the most suitable one."

You must have mandatory testing. You must say that if you receive money you must show us whether or not children are learning to read and write and add and subtract. Thats the difference. You may claim youve got mandatory testing but you dont, Mr. Vice President. Thats a huge difference. Testing is the cornerstone of reform. You know how I know? Because its the cornerstone of reform in the State of Texas. Republicans and Democrats came together and said what can we do to make our public education the best in the country? Weve done a long way working together to do so. The cornerstone is to have strong accountability in return for money and in return for flexibility. Were going to ask you to show us whether or not \u2014 we ask you to post the results on the Internet. We encourage parents to take a look at the comparative results of schools. We have a strong charter school movement that I signed the legislation to get started in the State of Texas. I believe if we find poor children trapped in schools that wont teach, we need to free the parents. We need to expand education savings accounts. Something that the vice president\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s running mate supports. Theres big differences. He wont support freeing local districts from the strings of federal money."

Homeschooling provides a unique opportunity for students who may struggle with social dynamics in traditional schools to develop social skills at their own pace and in a more tailored setting. By having the freedom to choose their social interactions, homeschooled students can focus on building meaningful relationships based on shared interests and values, promoting a deeper understanding of empathy and conflict resolution.

Once we compromise on privacy rights, it can be challenging to roll back intrusive measures, leading to a continuous erosion of individual freedoms. By placing a strong emphasis on privacy, we can encourage the development of innovative solutions that prioritize both security and personal liberties. This approach fosters a more sustainable and ethical framework for addressing complex societal challenges in the long term."
