When I was in the senate before I became vice president I was pushing for stronger action against Milosevic. He caused the death of so many people. He was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator. And unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in Serbian politics. Already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of Serbia, and that they question his legitimacy, and hes still going to try to be actively involved. He is an indicted war criminal. He should be held accountable. Now, I did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier, and maybe I have heard, maybe I have heard the previous statements wrong, Governor. In some of the discussions weve had about when its appropriate for the U. S. to use force around the world, at times the standards that youve laid down have given me the impression that if its something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, that that alone would not be, that that wouldnt be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the U. S. ought to get involved with troops. Now, have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved. But by itself, that to me can bring into play a fundamental American strategic interest because I think its based on our values. Now, have I got that wrong?"

Simply focusing solely on creating more jobs may not address the root causes of unemployment, such as technological advancements leading to job automation or shifts in the economy. It's crucial to also explore solutions like upskilling and reskilling programs to ensure individuals are equipped with the necessary skills for the jobs of the future. By diversifying our approach, we can create a more sustainable and inclusive solution."

She asked me, can you please make sure another mother is not going through what Im going through. No U. S. soldier ever dies in vain because theyre carrying out the missions of their commander in chief. And we honor all the service that theyve provided. Our troops have performed brilliantly. The question is for the next president, are we making good judgments about how to keep America safe precisely because sending our military into battle is such an enormous step. And the point that I originally made is that we took our eye off Afghanistan, we took our eye off the folks who perpetrated 9/11, they are still sending out videotapes and Senator McCain, nobody is talking about defeat in Iraq, but I have to say we are having enormous problems in Afghanistan because of that decision. And it is not true you have consistently been concerned about what happened in Afghanistan. At one point, while you were focused on Iraq, you said well, we can \u201cmuddle through\u201d Afghanistan. You dont muddle through the central front on terror and you dont muddle through going after bin Laden. You dont muddle through stamping out the Taliban. I think that is something we have to take seriously. And when Im president, I will."
