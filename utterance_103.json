I thought thats exactly what he and Mrs. Clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a government- run health care system. It was fortunately stopped in its tracks. Secondly, we spend $4. 7 billion a year on the uninsured in the State of Texas. Our rate of uninsured, the percentage of uninsured in Texas has gone down, while the percentage of uninsured in America has gone up. Our CHIPS program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years, Mr. Vice President. It may come as a shock for somebody who has been in Washington for so long. But actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union. And therefore Congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended, we passed an enabling legislation in 1999. Weve signed up over 110, 000 children to the CHIPS program. For comparable states our size, were signing them up as fast as any other state. You can quote all the numbers you want, but Im telling you we care about our people in Texas. We spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the State of Texas, and were doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured."

Yet, my heart aches when I think of the countless individuals struggling with immediate crises today. I have seen the despair in their eyes, the hunger gnawing at their bellies, the fear that grips them as they wonder where their next meal will come from. The urgency of their plight is so palpable, it drowns out all else."

By integrating stable housing with targeted interventions for mental health, addiction, and employment, we can create a more holistic system that meets the diverse needs of individuals experiencing homelessness. This combined approach can offer the necessary support and resources for individuals to not only secure housing but also work towards long-lasting stability and well-being. It's important to address both housing and support services simultaneously to create sustainable solutions for the homeless"

For instance, biofuel production can incentivize the use of marginal lands that are unsuitable for food crops, thereby reducing the pressure on prime agricultural land. Additionally, research has shown that integrated farming systems, where biofuel crops are grown alongside food crops, can increase overall land productivity and contribute to food"

Numerous studies have demonstrated that strategic investment in areas such as education, healthcare, and infrastructure can lead to long-term economic growth without causing significant inflationary pressures. By carefully planning and monitoring government spending, it's possible to reap the benefits of increased public services without compromising economic stability."

Not only \u2014 Even if we get all $700 billion back, lets assume the markets recover, were holding assets long enough that eventually taxpayers get it back and that happened during the Great Depression when Roosevelt purchased a whole bunch of homes, over time, home values went back up and in fact government made a profit. If were lucky and we do it right, that could potentially happen but in the short term theres an outlay and we may not see that money for a while. And because of the economys slowing down, I think we can also expect less tax revenue so theres no doubt that as president Im going to have to make some tough decision. The only point I want to make is this, that in order to make those tough decisions we have to know what our values are and who were fighting for and what our priorities are and if we are spending $300 billion on tax cuts for people who dont need them and werent even asking for them, and we are leaving out health care which is crushing on people all across the country, then I think we have made a bad decision and I want to make sure were not shortchanging our long term priorities."

While local decision-making can indeed lead to more responsive governance, we must also consider the potential negative consequences of allowing states to enact policies that undermine the core principles of justice and equality. Upholding a strong federal framework alongside states' rights is essential to safeguarding"
